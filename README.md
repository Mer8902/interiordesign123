Our project “INTERIOR DESIGN” is an effort to simplify the daily life of humans. In
today’s world, everyone is busy with one thing or the other and everyone does not have the
luxury of time to spend searching and finding a trusted interior designer. The main aim of our
project is to eliminate this pain of the user. We have extracted the details and have displayed it
in a simple and more user friendly interface where each of the users get personalized results.
Thus this greatly reduces the time he/she has to spend on searching interior designer which will
also help in optimizing given space by their own opinion.
This is one of the main problems as humans have faced for a long time. Our project also
includes several other features which aims at making humans and faculty’s life easier.
Our project basically has 3 modules:
1. Admin
2. Interior designer
3. User
